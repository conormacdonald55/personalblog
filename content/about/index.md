Hi, I'm Conor MacDonald.

I'm an engineer with a passion for automation and security. I enjoy finding ways to make my professional and personal enviroment more automated and more secure.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [conortmacdonald@protonmail.com](mailto:conortmacdonald@protonmail.com)

## My Links

* [My GitHub](https://github.com/conormacdonald55) - My GitHub account with my website and other software projects shown.
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conor-macdonald/) - Here you can view my professional achievements and experiences.

## This Website

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a popular open-source static site generator for building very fast and very flexible websites.
* [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) - A free, powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS. I found this theme to have robust documentation compared with than other Hugo themes. This theme is also super flexible and super pretty.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) - I use Cloudflare pages to automatically build and deploy my website through Cloudflare Pages which is linked to the GitHub repo of my website code. I also control my domain through Cloudflare (hosting, security, analytics) which I found to be very easy and intuitive to use. I am using Cloudflare's free tier.
* [VentraIP](https://ventraip.com.au/) - I registered my domain name through VentraIP. However, everything else associated with a website (hosting, deployment, security, analytics) is done through Cloudflare.

## Software

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - my preferred code editor for my website and other hobby projects like my homelab.
* [1password](https://1password.com/) - my preferred password manager and one I recommend to everyone. I can't tell you how good this password manager is and how simple it is to use. Great product - 10/10.
* [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app) - my authenticator app that I use for simple, fast and highly secure two-factor authentication.

<!-- ## Operating Systems

* Ubuntu core - for desktops
* Ubuntu server - for my server environments
* Proxmox - for my clustered server environment -->
