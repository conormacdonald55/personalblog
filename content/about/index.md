# Uses

Here is a list of all the software, technologies, and tools I use. 

## This Website

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a popular open-source static site generator for building very fast and very flexible websites.
* [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) - A free, powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS. I found this theme to have robust documentation compared with than other Hugo themes. This theme is also super flexible and super pretty. 
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) - I use Cloudflare pages to build and deploy my website through Cloudflare Pages. I also control my domain through Cloudflare (hosting, security, analytics) which I found to be very easy and intuitive to use. I am using Cloudflare's free tier.
* [VentraIP](https://ventraip.com.au/) - I registered my domain name through VentraIP. However, everything else associated with a website (hosting, deployment, security, analytics) is done through Cloudflare. 

## Software

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - my preferred code editor for my website and other hobby projects like my homelab. 
* [1password](https://1password.com/) - my preferred password manager and one I recommend to everyone. I cannot tell how good this password manager is and how simple it is to use. Great product 10/10.
